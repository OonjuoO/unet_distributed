# UNet

UNet architecture for Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation, built with TensorFlow 1.4.0 and optimized for multi-node execution on Intel KNL and Skylake servers.

## Overview

This repo contains code for multi-node execution:

	train_dist.py: Multi-node implementation for synchronous weight updates, optimized for use on Intel KNL servers.

## Setup

The following virtual environment must be present on all worker and parameter server (PS) nodes. Use conda to setup a virtual environment called 'tf' with the following command:

```
conda create -n tf -c intel python=2 pip numpy
```

This will default the conda environment to use the Intel Python distribution. Use `source activate tf` to enter the virtual environment, then install the following packages:

```
Tensorflow 1.4.0
SimpleITK
opencv-python
h5py
shutil
tqdm
```

Outside of the virtual environment, you'll need Ansible to be installed on your parameter server. (e.g. `sudo yum install ansible -y`)

We use Intel optimized TensorFlow 1.4.0 for Python 2.7. Install instructions can be found at https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-optimized-tensorflow-wheel-now-available.

## Required Data

Data files are not included in this public repo but can be provided upon request. We use the 2017 BRaTS dataset.

Data is stored in the following numpy files: 

```
imgs_test.npy
imgs_train.npy
msks_test.npy
msks_train.npy
```

Place these files in `/home/unet/data/slices/Results/` on the parameter server node. The parameter server is where we will run the distributed training script from.

## Modifications to settings file

Once environments are constructed which meets the above requirements, clone this repo anywhere on the parameter server.

Within the cloned directory 'unet', open `settings_dist.py` and replace the current addresses:ports in the `ps_hosts` and `worker_hosts` lists with the appropriate addresses:ports for your cluster.

Depending on your hardware, you may need to modify the NUM_INTRA_THREADS value. This code was developed on Intel KNL and SKL servers having 68 and 56 cores each, so intra-op thread values of 57 and 50 were most ideal. Please note that maxing out the NUM_INTRA_THREADS value may result in segmentation faults or other memory issues.

Note that a natural consequence of synchronizing updates across several workers is a proportional decrease in the number of weight updates per epoch and slower convergence. To combat this slowdown and reduce the training time in multi-node execution, we default to a large initial learning rate which decays as the model trains. This learning rate is also contained in `settings_dist.py`.

We provide the following flags for modifying system variables in Multi-Node execution: 

```
--use_upsampling    # Boolean, Use the UpSampling2D method in place of Conv2DTranspose (default: False)
--num_threads       # Int, Number of intra-op threads (default: 50)
--num_inter_threads # Int, Number of inter-op threads (default: 2)
--batch_size        # Int, Images per batch (default: 128)
--blocktime         # Int, Set KMP_BLOCKTIME environment variable (default: 0)
--epochs            # Int, Number of epochs to train (default: 10)
--learningrate      # Float, Learning rate (default: 0.0005)
--const_learningrate # Bool, Pass this flag alone if a constant learningrate is desired (default: False)
--decay_steps # Int, Steps taken to decay learningrate by lr_fraction% (default: 150)
--lr_fraction # Float, learningrate's fraction of its original value after decay_steps global steps (default: 0.25)
```

## Multi-Node Execution

We use an Ansible's playbook function to automate Multi-Node execution. This playbook will be run from the parameter server.
To initiate training, enter the command `./run_distributed_training.sh` in this cloned repo.

This command will run the `distributed_train.yml` playbook and initiate the following:

1. Create the `inv.yml` file from the addresses listed in `settings_dist.py`.
2. Synchronize all files from the `unet` directory on the parameter server to the `unet` directories on the workers.
3. Start the parameter server with the following command:

```
Parameter Server:	numactl -p 1 python test_dist.py 
```

4. Run the `Distributed.sh` bash script on all the workers, which executes a run command on each worker:

```
Worker 0:	numactl -p 1 python test_dist.py 
Worker 1:	numactl -p 1 python test_dist.py 
Worker 2:	numactl -p 1 python test_dist.py
Worker 3:	numactl -p 1 python test_dist.py 
```

5. While these commands are running, ansible registers their outputs (global step, training loss, dice score, etc.) and saves that to `training.log`. 

To view training progress, as well as sets of images, predictions, and ground truth masks, direct your chrome browser to `http://your_chief_worker_address:6006/`. After a few moments, the webpage will populate and a series of training visualizations will become available. Explore the Scalars, Images, Graphs, Distributions, and Histograms tabs for detailed visualizations of training progress. You may need to create a SSH tunnel if port 6006 is not visible on your chief worker.
